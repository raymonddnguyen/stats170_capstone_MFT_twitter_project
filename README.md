# Stats 170 Capstone
## Moral Foundations Theory Project with Twitter Data
#### Raymond Nguyen, Sherman Lu
Capstone project for Stats170 at UCI.  This project explores and analyzes the usage of Twitter data with Moral Foundations Theory.

* Our main project code can found in project.ipynb

* The datasets used can be found inside the data folder

* The Twitter scraping notebook can be found inside the twitter_scraping data.

We would like to additionally thank Ted Grover for the opportunity to work with him on this project and the guidance provided.

#### It should be noted that due to IRB conflicts, we could not provide the actual data.  We have provided simulated data that closely mimics the actual results.  In addition, the actual Mechanical Turk IDs have changed.
